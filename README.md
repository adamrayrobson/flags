# Flags

## Description

This is a full-stack web application built with [React](https://react.dev/), and bootstrapped 
with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).  It uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for the 
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and it displays a searchable list of the flags 
for every country in the world.
